# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This assignment required me to fetch server-side APIs to fetch city coordinate and weather data to display the weather forecast of my chosen city. The assignment also required that I store the user's search history in local data which then generates a button on the pages next visit. The user's searches are also stored in dynamically created buttons that they can then click on to view that forecast.

## Tasks

- Used GeoCode API to grab coordinates based on the city that the user input.
- Used OpenWeather API to display a five day forecast based on the coordinates grabbed by the GeoCode API
- created a function to store user inputs into the local storage, local storage inputs are then recovered and used to create dynamic buttons with previous user input data
- created an event listener that prompts user for their location and displays their local weather.
- used unsplash to display dynamic backgrounds.
